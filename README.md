# PerpetualCreativity's OLD dotfiles
These ~~are~~ used to be my dotfiles. The bootstrap script is meant for macOS[^1]. Some config files are for macOS-only software.

From these dotfiles, I switched to NixOS and then back to macOS (with a [new dotfiles repo](https://github.com/PerpetualCreativity/old-dotfiles)).

[^1]: even though the start of the script makes it look like it works on debian-based distros as well...

## ~~Install~~

0. `git clone https://github.com/PerpetualCreativity/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
1. `~/.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh`
