# PerpetualCreativity's dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. `bootstrap.sh` is not ideal.

## Install
0. Unfortunately, [karabiner-elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org) is not on homebrew, so download it manually.
1. `git clone https://github.com/PerpetualCreativity/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
2. `sh ~/.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh`
3. `vim ~/.vimrc` and then run `:source %` and `:PluginInstall`
